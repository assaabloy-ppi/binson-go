project-nov-2018.md
===================

Development project specification, November 2018. 

Requirements and notes:

* *Simple and short*. Should likely be less than 1000 lines of code, since that is possible in Java.

* *Only a low-level API*. This is enough for now. By low-level, I mean something like github.com/franslundberg/binson-java-light/.

* *Translate BinsonLight.java*. If possible, just translate (BinsonLight.java)[https://github.com/franslundberg/binson-java-light/blob/master/src/binson/BinsonLight.java]
  on a line-by-line bases.

* *Automatic testing*. This is a requirement.
